## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of EnginSync up and running.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* Git
* A C++ compiler (required by the `tokenizers` library, a dependency of `faster-whisper`)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/EnginSync.git](https://github.com/your-username/EnginSync.git)
cd EnginSync
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, use it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you should create one from the project's dependencies.)*

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

This project requires API keys and a secret key to function.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add the following configuration variables to your new `.env` file.

```
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your_super_secret_random_key_here'

# API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY='your_google_gemini_api_key'
YOUTUBE_API_KEY='your_youtube_data_api_key'
```

3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys.
    * `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Generate a random key. You can use `python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(24))'`
    * `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Get from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`: Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

### 5. Initialize the Database

The application uses an SQLite database. Make sure you have a `schema.sql` file to define the table structure. You can initialize it using a separate script or the Flask CLI.

```bash
# Example using Flask shell
flask shell
>>> from yourapp import init_db
>>> init_db()
>>> exit()
```
*(Note: You will need to implement the `init_db` function based on your `schema.sql`)*

### 6. Run the Application


```bash
app.py
```

The application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
